# 🧪 QA Engineer Bootcamp – Digital Skola
This repository highlights my learning progress from **Sessions 2, 3, and 4** of the QA Engineer Bootcamp at Digital Skola.

### 🧩 Overview
Each session focuses on a different aspect of software testing — from documenting test plans, test case, and bug reports to writing simple JavaScript scripts — blending hands-on practice with core QA fundamentals.

---

### 📘 Contents
**Task 2:** Test documentation — including **test plan, test case, and bug report** for the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website.  
**Task 3:** Practiced **JavaScript fundamentals** by generating a right-triangle pattern using a `for` loop.  
**Task 4:** Explored **JavaScript Advanced** concepts by building a simple calculator function for basic arithmetic operations.

---

### 🧭 How to Open the Project Folders
Depending on the file type, here’s how you can explore each session’s work:

#### 💻 For JavaScript Files
You can open these files with your favorite code editor, such as:
- Visual Studio Code  
- Sublime Text  
- Atom  

To open a folder directly in **VS Code**, use:
```bash
code folder-name
```

💡 Make sure VS Code is installed and added to your system PATH.

#### 📄 For Word, Excel, or Online Files

- Use the appropriate app depending on where you're opening it from:

- Microsoft Word (.docx) → open using Microsoft Word or Google Docs

- Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) → open using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets

You can simply double-click the file, or right-click → Open With… → choose the correct app or upload it to your Google Drive to open it online.

💡 Opening via Google Docs/Sheets is handy if you don't have Microsoft Office installed — just drag the file into Google Drive, and it'll open automatically.

📝 Notes

- Ensure you have VS Code, Word, or Excel installed before opening the files — or open them directly in Google Docs/Sheets.

- Keep the folder structure intact when submitting assignments.

- Each session reflects my progress as a QA Engineer — learning to plan, test, document, and write code to support automation in real-world projects.
